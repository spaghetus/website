# Welcome to my weird and horrifying website

This website's pages are generated using bash, makefiles, and pandoc, without a separate build step: `make` is called to update the generated version of each page as you request it.

To view the list of pages on this website in chronological order, see [/pages-chrono](/pages-chrono). You can use a path stub under `/pages-chrono` to filter by path, like [/pages-chrono/blog](/pages-chrono/blog). You can do the same things on [/pages-tree](/pages-tree) to view the pages alphabetically.

To download a page as a PDF or EPUB for your e-reader, you can replace the `.html` in the URL with `.pdf` or `.epub`. Try it with [this page!](index.md.pdf)

You can configure your experience using [the settings page](/page-settings).
