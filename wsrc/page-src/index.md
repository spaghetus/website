# Welcome to my weird website

Hello! My name is Willow, and I like to make things that help make lives easier, more fun, or preferably both.

I made this website with my bespoke webserver, [wwebs](https://github.com/spaghetus/wwebs). I've put thought into making it highly usable in all kinds of environments and for all kinds of people. If this website is difficult for you to use, or if it doesn't work well in a (reasonably recent) web browser, please let me know by [filing an issue](https://github.com/spaghetus/website/issues).

To view the list of pages on this website in chronological order, see [/pages-chrono](/pages-chrono). You can use a path stub under `/pages-chrono` to filter by path, like [/pages-chrono/blog](/pages-chrono/blog). You can do the same things on [/pages-tree](/pages-tree) to view the pages alphabetically.

To download a page as a PDF or EPUB for your e-reader, you can replace the `.html` in the URL with `.pdf` or `.epub`. Try it with [this page!](index.md.pdf)

You can configure your experience using [the settings page](/page-settings).
